## Golang : Concepts applied
  - GORM - It's a Object-relational mapping (ORM)library for Golang. It was used to setup up our database:
     * mapping a database struct
     * connecting to the DB
     * initial migration to our db
     
 - Fiber - It's an Express-inspired Go web framework built of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. It was used in our project to handle operations such as routing/endpoints and middleware. 
 
 - Fiber Template HTML: It's a template package that provides wrappers for multiple template engines. For our project we've used the engine html.
