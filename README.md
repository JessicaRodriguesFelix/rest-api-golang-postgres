> Welcome to my first Golang application. This is a fullstack app built in using Go Fiber, Docker and Postgres! In this first version, you will be able to visualize all questions/answers and add a new one to the list!   

## Tech Stack

Project was created using:
* Go 1.19.3
* PostgreSQL 15.1
* Docker version: 
    Client: 20.10.21
    Server: 20.10.21
    
## Usage
In your IDE terminal run:
```sh
docker compose up
```
## Golang : Concepts applied

  - GORM:  It's a Object-relational mapping (ORM)library for Golang. It was used to setup up our database:
     * mapping a database struct
     * connecting to the DB
     * initial migration to our db
     
 - Fiber: It's an Express-inspired Go web framework built of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go. It was used in our project to handle operations such as routing/endpoints and middleware. 
 
 - Fiber Template HTML: It's a template package that provides wrappers for multiple template engines. For our project we've used the engine html.

 - Go Air: It's a command-line utility that provides live reloading for Go applications.

 - Partials templates:
